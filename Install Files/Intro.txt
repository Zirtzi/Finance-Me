Welcome to Finance Me!

Finance Me is an application that is designed to give very basic finance assistance with user input. For instance, would you like to know how much of your paycheck will be
going to taxes? How about how much interest goes to your monthly payment on your mortgage? Or even totaling up expenses of your everyday life. Finace Me is designed to help you
with these tasks.

As development of this project will proceed, more features will be added as well as more refining to existing features. From stylistic to functionality you should expect an improving
application after every update. If you would like to learn more about Finance Me, just go to the information tab on the main screen and select the, "Info" tab. Enjoy!
