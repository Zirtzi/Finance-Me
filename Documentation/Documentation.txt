Welcome to Finance Me!

Finance Me is an application that is designed to give very basic finance assistance with user input. For instance, would you like to know how much of your paycheck will be
going to taxes? How about how much interest goes to your monthly payment on your mortgage? Or even totaling up expenses of your everyday life. Finace Me is designed to help you
with these tasks.

Amortization

An amortization table is designed to explicitly calculate how much of a loan is going towards interest and how much is going to principal. To begin with Finance Me's Amortization table, enter in your loan amount, the annual APR, and the term of the loan. Once these values have been entered just click, "Calculate" and your table will be populated with values.

Income Estimator

This income estimator is designed to give users a rough estimate of what they should expect with a paycheck. Begin by choosing your pay frequency in the drop down menu, then proceed to choose if you are tax-exempt or not. Once these options have been selected fill in the rest of the necessary information from tax rates to hours worked per week and your pay rate as well. NOTE: Future versions of Finance Me plan to implement a much easier UI for this part. Meaning a user will just select the state that they live (Subject to only U.S states) and then tax rates will be populated from there. Click, "Calculate" once all of the necessary fields have been filled out and you will get your income estimate.

Expense Estimator

This part of the application is very straight forward. Simply enter in your expense name and the cost of said expense. Proceed to click the, "Add" button to add this expense to the table. If you need to remove the most current entry, simply click on the, "Remove" button and the last entered row will be deleted. Once all of your expenses have been entered click on the, "Calculate" button to add up all of your expenses to get a full estimate of expenses.
