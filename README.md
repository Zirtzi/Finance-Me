Income Estimator

This income estimator is designed to give users a rough estimate of what they should expect with a paycheck. Begin by choosing your pay frequency in the drop down menu, then proceed to choose if you are tax-exempt or not. Once these options have been selected fill in the rest of the necessary information from tax rates to hours worked per week and your pay rate as well. NOTE: Future versions of Finance Me plan to implement a much easier UI for this part. Meaning a user will just select the state that they live (Subject to only U.S states) and then tax rates will be populated from there. Click, "Calculate" once all of the necessary fields have been filled out and you will get your income estimate.
